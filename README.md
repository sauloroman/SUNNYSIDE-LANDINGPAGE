Sunnyside is challenge from Front-End Mentor. In this project I carried out this design with code to practice my frontend skills. It has different sections where css properties are applied for the appropiate functionality of the page like grid and flexbox. 

It is responsive, it means that design addapts to different devices and screens. JavaScript is used for menu functionality and some transitions among sections.
